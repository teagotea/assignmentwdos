            <h2> Tea Manufacturers in Sri Lanka</h2>
            <p class="a">Sri Lanka’s tea cultivators and manufacturers are the custodians of the traditional, 
              orthodox method of black tea production. This is still agreed by most experts to produce the best black tea. 
              Even with the technological improvements introduced over the last thirty or forty years, the orthodox method is 
              relatively slow and labour-intensive; but as the tea planters and traders of Sri Lanka have always maintained, good tea 
              cannot be hurried. Nor, oddly enough, can it be delayed.<br><br>The time devoted to each of the processes of tea manufacture has to be
               finely judged if a quality product is to be obtained. This is a matter of the tea-maker’s judgment, for the right timing depends
                on the moisture content of the plucked leaf, the temperature and humidity conditions prevailing over the period of manufacture,
                 and a variety of other factors. Although the process of making fine black tea is simple in its essentials, expertise, experience
                  and a ‘feel’ for the task are absolutely essential to success.</p>

                    <p>Digging into Dilmah Tea history, Merrill J Fernando’s story begins in London as one of the first six Ceylonese who were trained in tea. 
                      While there, Merrill learnt how companies mixed tea from other countries with and added only a small portion of Ceylon tea, yet 
                      marketed it as “Ceylon tea”. Having realized that Ceylon tea despite being one of the finest type of teas in the world was exploited, 
                      Merrill wanted to build his own brand of tea where he could produce the finest quality. In 1988, he became the Founder of Dilmah Tea, 
                      and made sure that tea is handpicked, manufactured and packed at the source of its origin.  </p>

                    <p>The first broking firm John Brothers & Co. was established in 1876 and the first public Colombo auction took place in 1883 under
                       the guidance of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (which was established in 1839). The Colombo Tea Traders’ Association was formed in
                        1894 and in 1925 the Tea Research Institute was established. These organizations helped boost the production and export of Ceylon 
                        Teas in its early stages. These pioneering efforts were done by trial and error and improved over the years via the introduction and improvement of tea processing machines and methods,
                         by different individuals and companies.</p>
