<h1>Tea Health Benefits</h1>
        <p class="m"> Natural compounds, called polyphenols, are found in both caffeine and herbal teas. 
          These substances are antioxidants. They can help to mitigate the risk of certain chronic diseases. <br>Tea and herbs have numerous health benefits at large. Powerful antioxidants which function as free 
          radical scavengers, help to strengthen the immune system against degenerative diseases,<br> and possibly aid the prevention of infections. Studies indicate that tea may protect against heart disease, cancer, 
          arthritis, liver disease and osteoporosis. There is some evidence that drinking tea with<br> a meal aids in digestion and reduces protein and calorie absorption.</p>

    <h2>Weight Control</h2>
          <p>
              Some studies suggest that the caffeine and catechins, a type of polyphenol, 
              in tea may help with weight loss. Decaffeinated green teas did not appear to produce the same results.
              Although green tea is commonly believed to be a weight loss aid, there is no good evidenve that its long term consumption
               has any meaningful benefit in helping overweight or obese people to lose weight, or that 
               uit helps to maintain body weight.

    <h2>Heart Health</h2>
                <p>
                    Some study has indicated a decreased risk of heart attack in people who consume green or black tea daily.
                    one of the many known benefits uncovered by modern research : High tea consumption leads to a healthier heart.
                    while all four types of tea known as true teas - White, Green, Oolong and black - offer myraid health benefits,
                    most studies show that black and green teas are the heart health leaders.

    <h2>Diabetes</h2>
                <p>
                    Study on diabetes is less evident. 
                    Some studies indicate green tea catechins can help to keep blood sugar in check and reduce the risk of developing type.
                    Although green tea has been getting most attentionlately for its myraid health benefits, accumulating researcgh shows that black tea offers advantages too.
                    the latest revelation : black tea's abiliy to blunt increases in blood sugar.
                    For those of us at risk of type 2 diabetes, three to five cups of black tea per day helps stop type 2 diabetes
                    from developing.

    <h2>Cancer</h2>
                <p> 
                    Few research indicates that tea drinkers are at a lower risk for certain forms of cancer, but other studies do not confirm these results. 
                    It is not clear at this time whether drinking tea will reduce the chance of cancer.
                    Green tea has long been linked with positive health outcomes. It is full of antioxidants that have been associated with the prevention
                    of many ailments, including cancer. Drinking hot tea doesn't cause cancer on its own. If you 
                    regularly drink tea or other hot beverages and you have other risk factors like smoking and drinking alcohol,
                    you may have higher risk of kind of esophageal cancer.
